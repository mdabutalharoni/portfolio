Build a complete, production-ready personal portfolio website for:
Name: Md. Abu-Talha Roni
Tagline: Robot Enthusiast, Learner

## Tech stack (preferred)
- React + Vite
- React Router for multi-page/section navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for tasteful micro-animations
- Icon library (lucide-react or similar)
- No backend required; use static JSON/data files where needed

## Brand & Design
- Modern, clean, airy layout with good whitespace
- Color palette (feel free to refine): 
  - Primary: #6C5CE7 (indigo/violet)
  - Accent: #00D1B2 (teal)
  - Dark: #0F172A (slate-900)
  - Light: #F8FAFC (slate-50)
- Rounded-2xl cards, soft shadows, subtle hover effects
- Consistent typography scale; accessible contrast (WCAG AA+)
- Smooth section scrolling, sticky navbar on desktop, hamburger on mobile
- SEO tags + Open Graph + favicon

## Global Structure (Navbar)
Navbar entries (in order):
1) Home
2) About (with subsections: Education, Publication)
3) Skills
4) Projects
5) Products
6) Team
7) Contact

Use React Router routes:
- "/"         -> Home (a composed landing page with previews)
- "/about"    -> About full page (with Education & Publication sections expanded)
- "/projects" -> Projects listing + individual project pages ("/projects/:slug")
- "/products" -> Products listing + individual product pages ("/products/:slug")
- "/team"     -> Team page (roles and short bios)
- "/contact"  -> Contact page/section (also shown at bottom of Home)

## Home (Landing)
Order of content (top to bottom):
1) Hero section (below navbar):
   - Left: formal/subformal portrait inside an animated frame (e.g., rotating gradient border / subtle glow).
   - Right: "Hi, I am Md. Abu-Talha Roni" and tagline "Robot Enthusiast, Learner".
   - Prominent "Download CV" button:
     - Clicking opens the CV in a new tab and also allows download. Provide a placeholder file "public/cv.pdf" and wire it up.
2) About preview:
   - 3–4 sentence intro about me (placeholder text).
   - Two mini-cards labeled “Education” and “Publication” with tiny snippets.
   - A "Read more" link that navigates to /about (do NOT include full content here).
3) Skills:
   - A responsive grid of circular/rounded-rect skill badges (tech stack, tools, frameworks).
   - For software skills, include each official logo/icon in the badge.
4) Certificates (animated):
   - Carousel or slider with one certificate centered, others peeking left/right.
   - Auto-slide every few seconds.
   - Clicking any certificate opens its credential URL in a new tab.
5) Projects (preview):
   - 2–3 project cards shown on Home.
   - Each card: image, project name, short description, "Read more" linking to that project’s detail page.
   - Include a clear “View more projects” CTA that routes to /projects.
6) Products (preview):
   - Same card layout/behavior as Projects.
   - Show 2–3 on Home and a “View more products” CTA to /products.
7) Team (preview):
   - Card layout similar to projects but simpler (smaller descriptions).
   - Show role & org; each card has “Read more” to /team.
   - My roles to include:
     - Head Of Electrical — Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
     - Team Lead — Team Zenith
     - Member — RUET Electra Force
8) Contact (footer block on Home too):
   - Links: Gmail (mailto), GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook (open in new tab).
   - Show current location line (placeholder text like “Rajshahi, Bangladesh” that I can edit).
   - Copyright line: “© {currentYear} Md. Abu-Talha Roni. All rights reserved.”

## About (full page)
- A longer “About me” section (placeholder text).
- Subsections:
  1) Education: card list (degree, institution, year, highlight points).
  2) Publication: list items with title, venue, year, and external link if available.
- Keep content structured and easy to extend.

## Skills (full section/page)
- Data-driven list (JSON/TS object) including:
  - Category (e.g., Programming, Robotics, Embedded, ML/AI, Tools)
  - Name, logo (URL or local svg), proficiency level (optional)
- Display as circular/rounded-rect badges with logos and names; responsive.

## Certificates (component)
- Data structure: { title, issuer, issueDate, credentialUrl, image }
- Auto-animated carousel (Framer Motion or a lightweight slider).
- Click opens credentialUrl in new tab.

## Projects
- /projects: grid list of project cards with filters/search (optional).
- Each card: image, title, 2–3 line summary, tags.
- Card “Read more” -> dedicated page /projects/:slug with:
  - Hero image, full description, tech stack, role, timeline, links (repo/demo).

## Products
- Mirrored behavior to Projects.
- /products: listing + /products/:slug detail pages.

## Team
- /team page: cards with role, org, short description.
- Keep layout similar to Projects but simpler (no deep detail pages required; a modal or simple route is fine).

## Contact
- Contact section on a dedicated route AND as a footer block on Home.
- Include:
  - Email button (mailto: placeholder)
  - GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook icons/links
  - Current location line (placeholder)
- Add a simple contact form (Name, Email, Message) that uses mailto or a no-backend form service (e.g., formsubmit) with graceful fallback; show success/error toasts.

## Behavior & UX
- Smooth scroll to sections from navbar on Home.
- Active link highlighting.
- Keyboard accessible (tab order, focus states).
- Lazy-load images; use <picture> where helpful.
- All external links target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer".
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion (reduce animations).
- Include a light/dark mode toggle (persist in localStorage).
